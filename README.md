### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed as a Customer Engineer at Microsoft, focusing on serverless & PaaS services. In my spare time I like to tinker on a phone app that I'm currently building with some friends.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Vue, Typescript, NodeJS, Progressive Web Apps, Active Directory B2C, Azure Functions.

âš¡ Fun fact: I built my first website using MSN Groups when I was about 8 years old. I tried (ofcourse without any success) to get javascript to work on the website.
